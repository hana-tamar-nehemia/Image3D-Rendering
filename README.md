# Image3D-Rendering-
1.  The platform build from element:
    - Camera
    - many kind of ligths like: AmbientLight, PointLight, SpotLight,Directional Light 

2.  The platform build from geometries:
    - Cylinder, Plane, Polygon, Sphere, Triangle, Tube
    
3.  also we create premitive thing:
    - Color, Material, Point3D, Ray, Util, Vector
    
 All this object allow us to do 3D space to create a picture with cool features.
 
 We have built a kind of camera that render by light rays 
 and takes into account the distance of the objects and the strength 
 of the light and creates a virtual colorful 3-dimensional image
 
 The image can appear as if it is made of several different objectsthat are made of different materials, 
 for example glossy or matte
