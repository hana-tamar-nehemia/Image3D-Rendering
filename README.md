# Image3D-Rendering-
1.  The platform build from element:
    - Camera
    - many kind of ligths like: AmbientLight, PointLight, SpotLight,Directional Light 

2.  The platform build from geometries:
    - Cylinder, Plane, Polygon, Sphere, Triangle, Tube
    
3.  also we create premitive thing:
    - Color, Material, Point3D, Ray, Util, Vector
    
 All this object allow us to do 3D space to create a picture with cool features.
 
 We have built a kind of camera that render by light rays 
 and takes into account the distance of the objects and the strength 
 of the light and creates a virtual colorful 3-dimensional image
 
 The image can appear as if it is made of several different objectsthat are made of different materials, 
 for example glossy or matte
 
 The project build with Work in OOP-Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism, 
 also with TDD methodologies.
